Common implementation of sequential difference algorithm, including Sarsa and Q-Learning.

```cd learn``` and run ```python train.py``` to train these algorithms.

* Command line parameters:
* * ```-n```: Optional algorithm name: _"qlearning"_, _"sarsa"_
  * ```-ts```: Optional timesteps, default=500
  * ```-show```: Show regret or not, default=True
